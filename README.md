During the course I review and keep practicing html5 and css3 concepts such as:

- HTML attributes, tags, semantics
- CSS3 properties, selectors, values
- SEO
- Multimedia
- Box model
- Positioning
- Flexbox
- Forms
- Events
- Responsiveness
- And creating some components such as navbars, avatars, footers, cards, so on.
